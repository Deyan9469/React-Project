# Introduction
Hello, this is my Project for Soft-Uni called Bedsheet4You
For the project I am using Vite + React
# Start up
To start the project you will need:
1. Set up 2 terminals one for folder `client` and another in folder `server`
2. In folder `client` type in terminal `npm install`
3. In folder `server` with the second terminal type `node server`, to start the server
4. In client terminal you can start the project with `npm run dev`

From there Vite will generate <http://localhost:3000>, click it and view my project for bedsheets shop.
